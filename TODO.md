Library considerations:

[ ] Make randomizer random. Seed it I assume.
[X] Add Robot for game state
[ ] Add tinykeys for input
[ ] Add Lit for DOM rendering
[ ] Add ts-pattern for reducer
[ ] Integration test for Freeplay mode: initialize the app, play the first 7-10 pieces, expect finesse errors and lineclears and gravity and DAS
