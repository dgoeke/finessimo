## Library considerations

[ ] Add Lit for DOM rendering
[ ] Add ts-pattern for reducer
[ ] Integration test for Freeplay mode: initialize the app, play the first 7-10 pieces, expect finesse errors and lineclears and gravity and DAS
[ ] Update finesse BFS to support soft drops (ugh)
[ ] Game mode: learn openers
